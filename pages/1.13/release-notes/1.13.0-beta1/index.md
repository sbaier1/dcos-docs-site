# Release summary
The DC/OS 1.13.0 (Beta) release is intended for testing and evaluation purposes. You should not deploy this release in a production environment or attempt to upgrade any cluster components using this version of the software. You should only use this Beta release to install new, non-production clusters.

You are encouraged to provide feedback on the new features and services at [support.mesosphere.com](https://support.mesosphere.com).

# New features and capabilities

DC/OS 1.13.0 (Beta) includes new features and capabilities to enhance the installation and deployment experience, simplify cluster administration, increase operational productivity and efficiency, and provide additional monitoring, alerting, logging, and reporting for better visibility into cluster activity.

Some highlights for this release include:
- Monitoring and metrics for cluster operations
- Improvements to the Universal installer and upgrade process
- New features and options for command-programs
- New dashboard options for monitoring cluster performance
- Tighter integration between the Mesosphere Kubernetes Engine (MKE) and Edge-LB load balancing

## Monitoring and metrics for cluster operations
- The DC/OS monitoring service (`dcos-monitoring`) uses DC/OS storage service (DSS) volumes to store time-series data. <!--(DCOS-47725)-->

    With this release, you can store the information collected by the DC/OS monitoring service (`dcos-monitoring`, version 0.4.3) in the profile-based storage provided by the DC/OS Storage Service. By using the DC/OS Storage Service to store the monitoring data used in Prometheus queries and Grafana dashboards, you can improve the performance and reliability of the Prometheus and Grafana monitoring components.

    When you install the DC/OS monitoring service, you can select the volume size and a volume profile for the file system where you want to storing the Prometheus time-series database (`tsdb`). By specifying a volume managed by the DC/OS Storage Service, you can take advantage of the durability, performance, and flexibility DSS provides for your collected data. 
    
    For more information about working with the DC/OS monitoring service, see [DC/OS Monitoring Service](/services/beta-dcos-monitoring/0.4.3-beta/). For more information about using the DC/OS storage service, see [DC/OS Storage Service](/services/beta-storage/0.5.3-beta/).

- New volume and network metrics <!--(DCOS-47722)-->

    The metrics collection service, dcos-telegraf can now collect additional metrics for Mesos volumes and network information. For a complete list of the Mesos metrics you can collect and report, see the latest list of metrics provided here: http://mesos.apache.org/documentation/latest/monitoring/.

- Key metrics are collected by default <!--(DCOS-47719)-->

    In DC/OS 1.13, dcos-telegraf automatically collects Mesos metrics by default. Previously, you were required to manually enable the metrics plug-in by updating the agent configuration or by setting the `enable_mesos_input_plugin` parameter in the `config.yaml` file to `true`.  With this release, manually enabling this feature is no longer required. Instead, the default value for the parameter is now set to true. You can set the `enable_mesos_input_plugin` parameter in the `config.yaml` file to false if you want to disable the automatic collection of Mesos metrics.

- The DC/OS monitoring service enables you to mport curated alerting rules <!--(DCOS-47666)-->

    With this release, deploying the DC/OS monitoring service enables you to import Mesosphere-provided Prometheus Alert Rules from a github repository. These predefined alert rules enable you to create meaningful alerts concerning the condition of the DC/OS cluster, including successful or failed operations and node activity. Repo is located here: https://github.com/dcos/prometheus-alert-rules

    Prometheus alert rules are automatically included as part of the DC/OS monitoring service. Each DC/OS component or framework available for monitoring should have a single rule file that contains all its alert rules. These alert rules are passed to Prometheus using the `rule_files` configuration parameter and are configured to specify one of the following severity levels:
    - **Warning** alerts identify issues that require notification, but do not require immediate action. For example, an alert identified as a warning might send email notification to an administrator but not require an immediate response.
    - **Critical** alerts identify issues that require immediate attention. For example, a critical alert might trigger a pager notification to signal that immediate action is required.

- Create Curated Dashboard Collection for installation by customers in existing Prometheus/Grafana (DCOS-44740)
Operators deploying dcos-monitoring can now leverage Mesosphere provided Grafana dashboards.  These dashboards can be automatically retrieved by the dcos-monitoring service and enable the operator to quickly get up to speed in visualizing the metrics that the dcos-monitoring package is collecting from the cluster and its' hosted applications.  Dashboard repository is located here: https://github.com/dcos/grafana-dashboards

<!-- not in the 1.13 Docs in RN filter
- Standardized log collection and forwarding via fluentbit (DCOS-43412)
Application and DC/OS cluster component logs are now aggregated and Operators can configure forwarding to a third party log storage, search and reporting application. Previously, Operators had to install 3rd party Agents on cluster nodes to perform this task. With the introduction of support for fluent bit, Operators can now leverage easy to configure plugins to perform log filtering and forwarding to a log collection, search and reporting system.
-->

- Deprecate and remove the DC/OS history service <!--(DCOS-50304)-->
In DC/OS 1.13, the  DC/OS history service has transitioned into the **retired** state. The history service is scheduled to be decommissioned in DC/OS 1.14. You can find the definitions for each of the feature maturity states documented in the [Mesosphere DC/OS Feature Maturity Lifecycle](/1.13/overview/feature-maturity/).

## Command-line interface
- Easily obtainable Public-IP of the public agents through DC/OS CLI (DCOS-44697)
Operators can now obtain the public IP address of a public agent by running the command {{dcos node list}}.

- Auto Install Enterprise CLI (DCOS-39775)
For customers running DC/OS Enterprise Edition, the Enterprise CLI is now automatically installed when the non-Enteprise CLI is installed.

- Basic Tab Completion (DCOS-39774)
Operators can now use "tab completion" to assist with quickly executing DC/OS commands.

- Dynamic auto-complete for dcos cluster attach / remove (DCOS-47214)
Operators can now hit "tab" for the commands {{dcos cluster attach}} and {{dcos cluster remove}} to auto-fill in or auto-complete the possible clusters for this command.

- CLI support for macOS using Homebrew <!--(DCOS-47562)-->

    Homebrew is a software package management program you can use to install and configure packages for computers running macOS or Linus operating systems. With this release, you can install the DC/OS command-line interface (CLI) packages using the Mac OSX `homebrew` utility. Previously, you were required to download all DC/OS CLI plug-ins directly from the DC/OS cluster. By adding support for the Homebrew package manager, operators and developers can keep their CLI packages up-to-date using the `brew` command. For example, you can update the core CLI package by running the following command:

    ```bash
    brew install dcos-cli
    ```
    
    For more information about installing and using Homebrew, see https://brew.sh/ or the GitHub repository https://github.com/Homebrew/brew.
